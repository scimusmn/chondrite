# Chondrite

A Meteor JS project boilerplate/skeleton.

## Work in progress
This isn't ready for primetime yet.

## Biases
We use Meteor for some specific purposes that might not be applicable to everyone. Here are some of the entirely self-centered biases that you'll see in this boilerplate.

* I generally like flat document structures. We don't work on huge applications, so I'd rather have things one or two levels in vs. seven.
* I don't feel like it's neccesary to indicate the server/client/both breakdown in the folder structure. There's obviously still a server and client folder, but things like the router, don't need an extra folder to indicate that they execute in both.

## Credit
